# Demo Video Script (7 minutes)

## Introduction (30 seconds)

"Hi! I'm [Your Name], and I've built a multi-tenant Shopify Data Ingestion & Insights Service for the Xeno FDE Internship assignment. This platform helps enterprise retailers onboard multiple Shopify stores, sync their data, and gain valuable business insights through interactive dashboards."

**Show**: Application overview slide or homepage

## Problem & Solution Overview (45 seconds)

"The challenge was to build a system that can handle multiple Shopify stores with complete data isolation, real-time synchronization, and meaningful analytics. My solution provides:

1. Multi-tenant architecture supporting multiple Shopify stores
2. Automated data ingestion for customers, orders, and products
3. Interactive dashboard with key business metrics
4. Secure authentication and data isolation"

**Show**: Architecture diagram from ARCHITECTURE.md

## Technical Stack (30 seconds)

"I chose a modern, scalable tech stack:
- Backend: Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL for robust data handling
- Frontend: React with Recharts for interactive visualizations
- Authentication: JWT-based security
- Deployment: Ready for Heroku, Railway, or Render"

**Show**: Code structure in IDE

## Live Demo - Authentication (45 seconds)

"Let me show you the application in action. First, the authentication system:"

**Demo Steps**:
1. Navigate to login page
2. Click "Register" to create new account
3. Fill in: Name, Email, Password
4. Show successful registration and automatic login
5. Briefly show the JWT token in browser dev tools

**Say**: "The system uses JWT tokens for secure, stateless authentication with bcrypt password hashing."

## Live Demo - Multi-Tenant Setup (60 seconds)

"Now let's set up multiple Shopify stores to demonstrate multi-tenancy:"

**Demo Steps**:
1. Click "Add Store" button
2. Add first store: "Fashion Boutique" with domain "fashion-boutique.myshopify.com"
3. Add second store: "Tech Gadgets" with domain "tech-gadgets.myshopify.com"
4. Show store selector dropdown
5. Switch between stores to show data isolation

**Say**: "Each tenant has completely isolated data. Users can manage multiple Shopify stores from a single dashboard, which is crucial for enterprise clients managing multiple brands."

## Live Demo - Data Synchronization (60 seconds)

"Let's sync data from Shopify:"

**Demo Steps**:
1. Select "Fashion Boutique" store
2. Click "Sync Data" button
3. Show loading/success message
4. Explain the mock data being used for demo purposes
5. Switch to "Tech Gadgets" and sync that data too

**Say**: "In production, this would connect to real Shopify APIs using OAuth. For this demo, I'm using realistic mock data that simulates customers, orders, and products from actual Shopify stores."

## Live Demo - Dashboard Analytics (90 seconds)

"Now for the insights dashboard - this is where the real value comes from:"

**Demo Steps**:
1. **Metrics Overview**: Point out total customers, orders, revenue, products
2. **Revenue Trend Chart**: Explain the 30-day trend line
3. **Top Customers Chart**: Show bar chart of highest spenders
4. **Recent Orders Table**: Scroll through order details
5. **Multi-store Comparison**: Switch stores to show different data

**Say**: "The dashboard provides real-time insights that help retailers understand their business performance. The revenue trend shows growth patterns, top customers help identify VIP clients for targeted marketing, and the orders table provides operational visibility."

## Technical Deep Dive (90 seconds)

"Let me show you the technical implementation:"

**Demo Steps**:
1. **Backend Code**: Show Express routes structure
2. **Database Models**: Explain Sequelize ORM and relationships
3. **Multi-tenancy**: Show how tenantId isolates data
4. **API Endpoints**: Demonstrate REST API structure
5. **Frontend Components**: Show React component architecture

**Say**: "The backend uses Express with Sequelize ORM for clean database interactions. Multi-tenancy is achieved through tenant IDs that isolate all data queries. The frontend is built with React components and uses Recharts for beautiful, responsive visualizations."

## Deployment & Production Readiness (45 seconds)

"The application is deployment-ready:"

**Demo Steps**:
1. Show package.json scripts
2. Show environment configuration
3. Show Procfile for Heroku
4. Mention database migrations and scaling

**Say**: "I've included comprehensive deployment guides for Heroku, Railway, and Render. The application includes proper environment configuration, database migrations, and is ready for production scaling."

## Trade-offs & Future Enhancements (30 seconds)

"Key trade-offs I made for this assignment:

1. **Mock Data**: Used realistic mock data instead of full Shopify OAuth integration for demo purposes
2. **Simplified Authentication**: Basic email/password instead of enterprise SSO
3. **Manual Sync**: Button-triggered sync instead of real-time webhooks

For production, I'd add:
- Real Shopify API integration with OAuth
- Webhook-based real-time sync
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Role-based access control"

## Conclusion (15 seconds)

"This solution demonstrates my ability to build scalable, multi-tenant SaaS applications with modern technologies. It showcases the kind of customer-facing engineering that FDEs do - taking complex business requirements and delivering clean, functional solutions."
